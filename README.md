# Purpose of the project

This project is to experiment with Google's AI studio API. I want to develop a front end page for interacting with the API, acting as a web page for users to query a particular model.

# Setup

Because I am selfish, I will not be sharing my API key. Sorry. So I included '.example.env'. You can make a copy of this file and rename it to '.env', and fill out any of the information you find yourself needing.
